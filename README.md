# Mozu Core Theme

The Mozu Core theme is the foundation upon which you can build your own Mozu theme. To get started with the Mozu Core theme, refer to the [Theme Asset Management](https://www.mozu.com/docs/developer/dev-center/manage-themes.htm) documentation. Once you're up and running, you can learn how to customize themes using the [Theme QuickStart](https://www.mozu.com/docs/developer/themes/quickstart.htm).

## Release Notes: Merge the Latest Core Updates

Mozu continually updates the Core theme. Sometimes, you may have to merge an update from Core into your theme to enable a newly-released feature in Admin or complete the installation of a Mozu application that you obtained through the [Mozu Marketplace](https://www.mozu.com/marketplace).

For the latest enhancements, see the [Release Notes](https://github.com/Mozu/core-theme/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.md).
